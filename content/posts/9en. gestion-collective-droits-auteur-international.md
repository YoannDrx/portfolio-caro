# Collective management of copyright: how does it work internationally?

### Collective management organizations (CMOs) around the world

Collective management organizations\*\* (CMOs) play a key role in protecting and managing artists' copyrights worldwide. These organizations help artists obtain economic benefit from their works, covering a wide range of rights, including reproduction, broadcasting and communication to the public.

Here are a few examples of major _OGC_ organizations:

- **SACEM** (Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Éditeurs de Musique): Based in France, this organization is dedicated to collecting and distributing royalties due to music creators.
- **SPEDIDAM** (Société de Perception et de Distribution pour les Artistes-Interprètes): A French company that manages performers' rights.
- SDRM\*\* (Société pour l'administration du droit de reproduction mécanique des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs): This society manages mechanical reproduction rights in France.

> It is thanks to the work of these organizations that artists are compensated for their creative work and can continue to produce new works. As artists, it's essential to understand how these organizations work, and how they can help protect and monetize your work.

Each country has its own OGC, and the methods for collecting and distributing royalties vary from one organization to another. It is therefore advisable for artists to find out more about these organizations to maximize their profits and protect their rights.

### Reciprocal agreements between OGCs

Hearing your own song played on the radio or in a restaurant can be an incredible experience for an artist. It's also an important source of revenue for collective management organizations (CMOs) such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM. But what do these reciprocal agreements between these organizations really mean, and how do they work?

\*\*What are reciprocal agreements?

In simple terms, a reciprocal agreement is an agreement between two OGCs enabling one to collect royalties on behalf of the other within its territory. OGCs have set up these agreements to ensure that artists are remunerated for the use of their works, even when it takes place abroad. So, if you're a French artist and your music is played in England, the British rights management society (PRS for Music, for example) will collect the royalties on your behalf and pass them on to you via your OGC in France.

> Please note that each OGC has its own royalty distribution policy. It is therefore important to find out more before registering.

- _SACEM_: Sacem (Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique) is a French OGC that represents and protects the copyright of its members in France and abroad.
- SPEDIDAM\_: SPEDIDAM (Société de perception et de distribution des droits des artistes-interprètes) is a CMO representing performers in France. It collects and distributes royalties for the public exploitation of their recordings.
- SDRM\_: SDRM (Société pour l'administration du droit de reproduction mécanique) is an OGC specialized in the collection and distribution of royalties due for the mechanical reproduction of musical works.

Now that you're familiar with the reciprocal agreements and roles of each CMO, the next step is to learn how to negotiate and maximize your copyright revenues. Read on to find out more.

### Challenges of global rights management

In music production, rights management is a key issue. On a global scale, this becomes even more complex due to the diversity of legal systems and regulations in force in each country. But don't worry! Let's take a look at the main challenges you may face on a global scale, and how to overcome them.

- **Different laws and regulations:** Understanding all the legal provisions of each territory involves intensive research and analysis to avoid any unintentional legal violations.
- Managing different collective management societies (CMS):\*\* Each country has its own CMS, for example in France we have Sacem, Spedidam, SDRM, and it's important to understand how each system works to ensure a fair distribution of revenues.
- Contract negotiation:\*\* The terms of agreement, the interpretation of contracts and their implications can differ from country to country. A rights assignment contract in Australia may not have the same legal meaning as in France or the USA.
- Language problems:\*\* It is essential to understand the language of the target country in order to be able to analyze contracts and other legal documents correctly.

> This may seem a little complex to tackle, but by paying close attention to these essential aspects, you can successfully navigate the different seas of copyright management in the music world.

Over the next few blog posts, we'll help you demystify each of these challenges. We'll provide you with useful tools and tips for effectively negotiating rights assignment contracts, understanding the distribution of income from Sacem, Spedidam and SDRM, and much more. So stay tuned!

### Best practices for international artists

As an international artist, navigating copyright and intellectual property can sometimes seem confusing. Yet it's crucial to understand and implement certain practices to protect your work and make the most of it financially. Here are some of the best practices for international artists:

- **Understand the copyright laws in your country** - Copyright laws vary from country to country. So it's important to know your country's specific laws. This knowledge can help you protect your works and understand how and when they can be used by others.
- Protect your works through copyright\_ - Register your works with the appropriate copyright organization in your country. This will give you extra protection in the event of infringement of your rights.
- Understand assignment of rights contracts\*\* - Assignment of rights contracts are agreements by which you assign some or all of your copyright to another party. Read these contracts carefully before signing them and, if possible, consult a lawyer.
- Negotiate your contracts effectively\_ - An artist's success depends largely on his or her ability to negotiate contracts effectively. Learn about standard industry practices and don't be afraid to ask for what you think you deserve.

> Knowledge is an artist's best tool for navigating the music industry. Make sure you understand copyright laws, protect your work, know the details of rights assignment contracts and always negotiate effectively.

### Case studies: successes and failures

Understanding **rights assignment contracts** is essential for any artist wishing to make a career in music. Many artists have succeeded, while others have failed. It's important to understand why. So let's take a look at some of the notable successes and failures.

> "Knowledge of rights and contracts can make the difference between a successful career and one that doesn't."

Let's start by talking about some **successes:**

- The first example that comes to mind is **Taylor Swift**. In 2019, she struck a deal with Universal Music Group that stipulated that if the company were to sell any of its shares in Spotify, it would share the profits with its artists. Swift's knowledge and negotiation of the details of her contract enabled her to protect her interests and share in industry advances.
- Another notable success in the French music industry is that of **Stromae**. He has been very careful in negotiating his contracts, ensuring that he retains complete creative control over his music.

Now, let's talk about some **failures:**

1. **Prince**: Following a $100 million contract with Warner Bros in 1992, Prince found himself in conflict with the record company over issues of control and ownership. This led to a period in which he appeared in public with the word "slave" written across his face.
2. _The Verve_: This British band had a difficult experience with their track Bitter Sweet Symphony. Because of an unauthorized sample by the Rolling Stones, all rights went to the latter band, despite the song's international success. The case of The Verve is a warning to all artists about the importance of understanding and respecting copyright.

In conclusion, knowing and understanding your rights and negotiating contracts tailored to your needs as an artist are essential to protecting yourself and ensuring your success.

### The future of international collective management

International collective management is of great importance in today's music environment. The digital landscape offers artists an unprecedented platform for sharing their work with a global audience. However, it also raises complex copyright issues. Let's take a look at the future of international collective management.

- With the emergence of new digital platforms and music formats, copyright laws must be constantly updated to protect artists and their works. It is crucial that musicians, producers and publishers are aware of these changes and their impact on the protection of their music.
- The digitization of works:\*\* Musical works are now distributed via multiple digital platforms. These platforms require appropriate licensing agreements with collective management organizations to ensure fair remuneration for artists.
- The challenge of collecting royalties:\*\* With the globalization of the music industry, collecting royalties is becoming more complex. Collective management organizations must work together to meet this challenge.

> International collective management is more important than ever in today's digital landscape. Without effective management, artists may not be adequately compensated for their work."

To effectively negotiate rights assignment contracts and understand the impacts of copyright, it's essential to keep abreast of developments in international collective management. In the future, artists, producers and publishers will need to work in collaboration with collective management organizations to ensure fair remuneration for all parties involved.
