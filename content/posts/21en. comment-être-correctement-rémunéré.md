2. **Evaluation of contracts:** It is important to analyze all signed contracts related to the identified works. This may include licensing agreements, assignment of rights contracts, etc.
3. **Verification of contract compliance:** This step involves checking that the terms of each contract are respected. For example, if a contract specifies that the artist must receive royalties each time one of his works is played publicly, we need to check that these payments have been made.
4. \*\*Audits should also review payments received from copyright organizations such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM. Check that these payments correspond to the royalty reports.
