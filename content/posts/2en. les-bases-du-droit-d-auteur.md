# The basics of copyright in the music industry: what every artist needs to know.

Copyright\*\* in the music industry is a complex and crucial subject for every artist. It is a set of laws and regulations designed to protect creators from unauthorized use of their works. To successfully navigate these often troubled waters, it's essential to understand how copyright works.

Let's start by breaking down the **basics**.

- Copyright\*\*: In the simplest terms, copyright is a legal right that protects the originality of a work. For a song, this includes its melody, lyrics and recording.
- Copyright owner\*\*: The artist who created the work is usually the copyright owner. However, these rights can be sold, donated or inherited by others. Copyright holders have the right to authorize or prohibit the use of their works.

> Important : Copyright is different from performing rights. Both must be managed separately, and offer different sources of income for artists.

Once you've created a work - a song, for example - it's essential to register it with a copyright management organization, such as SACEM in France. These organizations collect licensing fees from music users and redistribute them to artists in the form of royalties.

1. Work registration\_: This is the first step towards copyright protection. The artist must register his or her work with a copyright administration society, which will administer these rights.
2. Collecting royalties\_: Once the work is registered, SACEM collects royalties when your music is played or broadcast publicly.
3. _Royalty distribution_: These royalties are then redistributed to the artist according to a points system based on the fame and success of the work.

Each step in this process is essential to ensure that your rights as an artist are respected and protected. In the following sections, we take a closer look at each aspect of copyright.

## Copyright in music: is my work automatically protected?

Understanding copyright in music is crucial for every artist. A common question is: "Is my work automatically protected?" While the answer to this question may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, in general, yes, your work is automatically protected by copyright from the moment it is created. However, it's important to understand the process in detail.

### Copyright conditions

1. **Originality:** To be protected, your work must be original, i.e. it must bear the stamp of your personality.
2. **Material form:** Your work must take concrete form. A mere idea or concept cannot be protected by copyright.

### Proving authorship

Although copyright applies automatically, it can be difficult to prove that you are the author of a work if a dispute arises. It is therefore advisable to :

- Register your work with a body such as SACEM or SPEDIDAM.
- Keep all documents relating to the creation of the work (e-mails, drafts, etc.).

> Copyright protection is different from patent protection. A copyright protects the artistic expression of an idea, while a patent protects an invention or discovery.

### Neighboring rights

In addition to copyright, artists may also have "neighboring rights". These rights are intended for performers, producers of phonograms and videograms, and broadcasting companies.

Each step in this process is essential to ensure that your rights as an artist are respected and protected. In the following sections, we take a closer look at each aspect of copyright.

## What rights do I have to my work?

As an artist, it's essential to understand the different facets of copyright in the music industry. Knowing your rights will ensure that your work is properly protected and that you are appropriately remunerated for its use. Here are the main rights you have over your work:

### Moral rights

> These rights are non-transferable and inalienable. They allow you to claim authorship of your work, and to object to any modification or use of it that would harm your honor or reputation.

### Property rights

- Reproduction rights:\*\* This is the exclusive right to control the copying of your work in any form whatsoever - printed, recorded, online, etc.
- Performance right:\*\* This gives you exclusive control over the public performance of your work, whether in concert, on the radio, on television, etc.
- Resale right:\*\* As an artist, you benefit from a resale right that entitles you to a share of subsequent sales of your work.

### Copyright management institutions

To help protect and manage these rights, there are several organizations such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM. Each of these organizations has a different role to play in managing your specific rights:

| Organization | Role |
| ------------ | ---- |

| SACEM is primarily responsible for collecting and redistributing royalties for private copying and public performance of music.
| SPEDIDAM collects and distributes royalties for the mechanical reproduction of music.
| SDRM is responsible for collecting and distributing royalties for the mechanical reproduction of musical works on all types of media.

In conclusion, it is imperative for every artist to understand and take full advantage of his or her copyright. This not only protects your work, but also guarantees fair remuneration for your hard work.

## Do I need to join SACEM? Advantages and disadvantages?

At the heart of the music industry, membership of a collecting society such as SACEM (Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique) is a key step for any artist wishing to protect their work and benefit from remuneration. But nuance is necessary. So, **do I need to join SACEM**? Here, we review the pros and cons of joining SACEM.

- Advantages:\*\*
  1. Protection of works:\_ Membership of SACEM guarantees effective protection against the illegal exploitation of your works. It ensures that your rights to your music catalog are respected.
  2. Remuneration:\_ SACEM collects and distributes the royalties generated by the exploitation of your works (in concert, on the radio, streaming, etc.).
  3. Support for creation :\_ SACEM also supports musical creation through project funding, training and events dedicated to songwriters.
- Disadvantages:\*\*
  1. Cost:\_ Membership of SACEM is not free, and the artist is responsible for managing rights.
  2. Long-term commitment :\_ Membership of SACEM entails a long-term commitment, with exclusivity on the exploitation of your works.
  3. Administrative complexity :\_ Managing copyright can be complex, requiring a good knowledge of the procedures and regulations in force.

> It is important to emphasize that each artist has specific needs in terms of rights management. Membership of SACEM may be particularly beneficial for some, while others may prefer alternative solutions. Consult a copyright advisor to make the best choice for your situation.

## Do I have the right to use a piece of music for 30 seconds on YouTube?

As an artist, it's essential to understand your copyright in the music industry, especially on popular platforms like YouTube. A common question is: "**Do I have the right to use a piece of music for 30 seconds on YouTube?**" The answer is not as simple as it might seem.

According to copyright case law, the use of any excerpt from a copyrighted work, regardless of its length, requires the authorization of the rights holder. This includes the use of 30 seconds of music on YouTube.

> Remember: "The use of any copyrighted work, regardless of length or intent, without the express permission of the rights holder, is likely to result in copyright infringement."

- The artist or record company that owns the rights must give you permission to use the music.
- YouTube policy:\*\* YouTube has its own copyright management system known as Content ID, which automatically scans videos for copyright-protected content.
- Consequences:\*\* Failure to comply may result in the deletion of your video, or even the suspension of your account.

It is therefore imperative that you obtain the appropriate authorization before using a piece of music in your videos, even if only for 30 seconds. Respecting copyright is not only a matter of respect for the artist's work and creativity, but also a legal necessity.

# Copyright in music: everything you need to know in 5 min.

## **Understanding copyright in music: an enlightening guide** (in French)

It's undisputed that music soothes our souls, but it's essential not to overlook the important legal aspect of protecting one's musical creations as a work of the mind.

As soon as the composition of a song or album is finalized, the author grants himself specific rights. These privileges are commonly referred to as : **music copyright**.

The concept of copyright includes **the exclusive prerogatives that an author or his successors in title hold over his intellectual works**. These can be literary or artistic in nature, and include books, music, designs, software, fashion creations, among many others.

In the case of music, copyright concerns the composer (author of the music) and lyricist (author of the lyrics) of the work. The aim here is to protect a composition or lyrics.

If you're a composer or lyricist and want to broaden your knowledge of copyright, this article is just what you need.

We're here to help and support you throughout your musical projects.

## Understanding copyright in the world of music: Is your creation already protected?

The world of music is exciting, but also complex. The very moment your creativity materializes in a piece of music, you become its author, and **copyrights naturally apply to your work,** whether it's romantic or rock, famous or unknown.

Despite this, if you ever need to defend your authorship of a work, it's crucial to prove its date of birth. In this case, an effective way of doing so would be to leave the imprint of your creation with a public official, such as a notary or bailiff, or even with INPI thanks to a Soleau envelope.

However, don't forget that **music copyrights only protect "original" works**. The originality of a musical work derives from its whole, a harmonious mix of melody, harmony and rhythm.

Intrigued by what makes us "original"? The Cour de cassation and the Cour d'appel de Paris have an answer for you. According to them, a musical work is said to be original if it reflects a "unique panorama which bears witness to creative efforts and an aesthetic bias bearing **the imprint of the personality of its author\***".

It should be noted, however, that the use of melodies frequently used in certain genres may well fall within the scope of originality if the whole gives an original impression. In addition, other factors can be taken into account to demonstrate a creative effort, such as melodic extensions or particular harmonic and rhythmic choices.

## What privileges do you enjoy as the author of your own musical work?

The magic lies in the originality of each creation! When a musical work is a unique and original composition, it is protected by **exclusive property rights** comprising **moral rights** and **economic rights**.

### Let's delve into the depths of moral rights

Imagine that **moral rights** are like a shield, protecting your precious musical work. They enable you to claim authorship of the work and guarantee respect for its integrity.

With these rights, you benefit from the following powers:

- The right of disclosure:\*\* You decide when and how your work will be presented to the public for the first time.
- The right to respect for your name and status:\*\* Every publication of your work must mention your name, unless you choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym.
- The right to respect for the work:\*\* Any modification, distortion or mutilation of the work without your consent is forbidden. For example, authorization is mandatory in the context of [sampling](https://beaubourg-avocats.fr/utiliser-sample-musique-plagier/).
- The right to withdraw and repent:\*\* You can stop exploiting your work at any time, provided you compensate the parties involved financially.

Good news! These moral rights are :

- Perpetual:\*\* They continue after your death and are passed on to your heirs.
- Inalienable:\*\* They cannot be sold or given away. Any contract to the contrary would be considered null and void.
- Imprescriptible:\*\* Non-use of these rights over a long period does not imply renunciation of their exercise.

### The importance of economic rights

Economic rights\*\* are your key to earning remuneration when your music is used by others. They play a crucial role in the reproduction and performance of your work.

**The reproduction right** allows you to authorize the recording of your music by any means, so that it can be distributed to the general public.

Therefore, each use of your copyright must receive your **explicit approval**. Whether your music is reproduced on a CD, broadcast on the Internet or used in a film or advertisement, your authorization is essential. Failure to do so will constitute [musical plagiarism](https://beaubourg-avocats.fr/plagiat-composition-musicale-droit/).

However, please note that copyright does not prohibit the use of your music at private, non-paying events within a strict family framework, or for making copies for private use, as well as for analysis and short quotations, provided you mention your name and the source.

Concerning **the right of performance**, this authorizes you to give or refuse permission to play your music in public, whether in concert or broadcast on television. Note that unlike reproduction, performance does not require a physical medium.

But unlike moral rights, which are eternal, economic rights have a limited duration. These rights **become public 70 years after the death of the author**, allowing anyone to exploit your work, provided they respect the moral rights of your heirs.

In short, you have **full control over the use of your work by third parties**.

However, it should be noted that the emergence of authors' societies has turned the relationship between authors and performers in the music industry on its head, making it all a little more complex.

## Is SACEM membership right for you? Let's weigh up the pros and cons\*\*.

SACEM\*\* operates as a not-for-profit civil society whose primary role is to collect and distribute revenues from the dissemination of works - whether in France or internationally - via various means such as radio, television, concerts, shows, streaming, as well as reproduction on various media such as records, videos, legal downloads, DVDs and video games.

SACEM transmits these funds directly and exclusively to authors, composers and music publishers. Consequently, **your membership becomes necessary only if your works are broadcast by the media or directly offered for sale on the market**.

From the moment you join a society of authors (such as SACEM) and register your work, **you give up the individual right to authorize its reproduction or public performance**. Membership of these societies automatically entails assignment of this right to authorize or prohibit.

**Societies of authors such as SACEM then take on the task of negotiating with users of works**, deciding on operating authorizations, conditions and royalties to be collected and distributed.

Consequently, **for societies of authors, authorization is systematically granted as soon as a royalty is paid**. In other words, the authors' society is always ready to offer its entire repertoire to any interested party, thus making it easier to obtain authorization.

In short, if you wish to use an original musical work that is not yet in the public domain, you will have to pay royalties to the society of authors.

## Can I use a piece of music for 30 seconds on YouTube without infringing copyright?

With the explosion of YouTube over the last ten years, the Internet is flooded with videos every day. Unfortunately, this is often accompanied by undue use of copyrighted music.

YouTubers, take note: the platform imposes a very strict policy regarding music copyrights. Many have had their videos demonetized, blocked, or both, for including copyrighted music.

Want to avoid these risks? Focus on **copyright-free music**. That way, you can still create audiovisual content without worrying about copyright infringement.

Some may be tempted to circumvent this rule by using copyrighted music for only 30 seconds in their videos. After all, YouTube's Content ID system generally cannot detect copyright infringement if the musical work is used for less than 30 seconds.

From a legal point of view, however, the situation is quite different. According to the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, the use of "_extracts of 30 seconds borrowed from songs with a total duration of 3 minutes_" is not considered short enough to be exempt from copyright.

So, what's the solution? Simple: acquire the copyright to the music. You can achieve this through the **[copyright assignment contract](https://beaubourg-avocats.fr/contrat-cession-droits-auteur/) for music.**
