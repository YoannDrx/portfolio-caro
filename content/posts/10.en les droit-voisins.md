# Neighboring rights: what every musician needs to know.

### Definition and importance of neighboring rights

Neighboring rights\*\* are an essential aspect of intellectual property in the field of music. These rights are generally granted to performers, phonogram producers and broadcasting organizations. While they are often referred to as 'rights' similar to those of authors, it is important to know that neighboring rights are distinct from copyright. Let's take a look at what they mean and why they are important.

> Neighboring rights are rights granted to performers, phonogram producers and broadcasting organizations. They are distinct from copyright and are of major importance for intellectual property, particularly in the field of music."

- Performers:\*\* Performers are protected both for their live performances and for their recorded interpretations. These protections include the right to control the broadcasting of their performances and to receive fair remuneration for the use of these performances.
- Phonogram producers:\*\* They are protected for their investments in the production of phonograms (sound recordings). This protection includes control over the reproduction, distribution, rental and making available to the public of these phonograms.
- Broadcasting organizations:\*\* They are protected for their investments in broadcasting. Protection includes control over the retransmission, communication and public availability of their broadcasts.

Neighboring rights play a central role in ensuring that all participants in the creation and dissemination of music are fairly remunerated for their contributions. Without these rights, it would be more difficult for artists and other holders of neighboring rights to secure income from their creations.

### The differences between neighbouring rights and copyright

Understanding the distinction between **neighboring rights** and **copyrights** is essential to navigating the music industry effectively. While they may seem similar at first glance, they have very different meanings and implications for artists, particularly in the context of rights assignment contracts.

Here's a detailed explanation of the two terms:

- _Copyright_: These are exclusive rights granted to a creator or author of an original work. They give the owner exclusive control over the use and distribution of their work. In the music industry, it is often the songwriter who holds the copyright to a song.
- Neighboring rights\_: In contrast, neighboring rights protect the interests of people who contribute to the production or distribution of a work, without necessarily being the author. This can include performers, record producers and broadcast organizers.

> In the musical context, while copyright mainly protects composers and lyricists, neighbouring rights tend to protect performers and producers.

It is crucial to note that copyright and neighboring rights offer different types of protection, and can often apply simultaneously to a single work. Understanding them well is essential when negotiating rights assignment contracts.

### How these rights are managed

Before delving into the heart of the matter, it's important to understand the concept of copyright and how it is managed. Simply put, copyrights are legal rights that protect a creator's original works, giving them exclusive control over how their work can be used by others.

> "Copyrights are legal rights that protect a creator's original works, giving him exclusive control over how his works can be used."

Now that we have a clear definition of copyright, let's take a look at how copyright is generally managed in the music industry:

- Personal management:\*\* Some artists decide to manage their copyrights themselves. This usually involves actively monitoring and taking legal action where necessary to prevent infringement.
- Using a rights management agency or organization:\*\* Many artists and creators join organizations such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM. These organizations collectively manage copyright, negotiate licenses, collect royalties and distribute them to artists.
- Assignment of rights contracts:\*\* Sometimes, an artist may choose to sell or assign his or her copyright to another party via an assignment of rights contract. This is often the case when the artist signs a contract with a record company or music publisher.

It is imperative to understand the implications of each method in order to manage your rights effectively and maximize your income as an artist.

### Income generated by neighboring rights

As an artist or music producer, you've probably already heard of **neighboring rights**. These are rights that enable performers and music producers to receive remuneration for the commercial use of their works. This commercial use may take the form of public broadcasting, radio broadcasting or reproduction of the work. In this article, we'll explore the different forms of revenue generated by these neighboring rights, and how you can maximize their value.

- Public performance royalties:\_ These royalties are collected when music is played in public, such as in a café, restaurant or store.
- Broadcast royalties:\_ These are royalties collected when your music is broadcast on radio, television or the Internet.
- Reproduction royalties:\_ These are levied when your music is reproduced, whether on CD, DVD, vinyl or any other physical medium.

> It's important to note that to collect these royalties, you need to register with the appropriate collecting societies, such as SACEM in France, or SPEDIDAM and SDRM for performers and producers.

It is also essential to carefully negotiate your rights assignment contracts to get the best possible return for your music. It may be wise to call on a professional to help you with these negotiations.

### Challenges and controversies

As an artist or creator, it's crucial to understand the importance of assignment of rights agreements. These agreements explicitly state who owns the rights to your work, making it possible to specify who may reproduce, distribute or broadcast it. It's a technical subject, but essential for all artists, whether novice or established.

\*\*Challenges and controversies

Negotiating a rights assignment contract is not without its challenges. Artists often find themselves having to master complex legal language, and the terms of the agreement can sometimes seem unbalanced in favor of record companies or publishers. Moreover, questions of remuneration are often a bone of contention.

- Reluctance to assign rights:\_ Many artists are reluctant to assign their rights, fearing that they will lose control over their own work. It's important to understand what assigning rights means and how it can affect your career in the long term.
- Lack of clarity:\_ It can sometimes be difficult to understand what exactly an assignment of rights contract means, as the legal terms can be so obscure. That's why it's important to take the time to fully understand each clause before signing.
- Negotiating royalties:\_ One of the most controversial aspects of these contracts is the question of remuneration. How much should the artist receive each time his or her work is used? How is this sum determined? These are all questions that can lead to tough negotiations.

> As an artist, it's crucial to protect your rights and understand exactly what you're signing. Take the time to inform yourself and, if necessary, seek the advice of a legal expert or copyright consultant.

### Case studies and practical examples

Before diving into the details of copyright assignment contracts, it can be useful to understand how they work in reality. Let's take a look at some case studies and practical examples to help you understand.

**Case 1: John, songwriter** > John is a songwriter.

> John is an independent songwriter. He creates popular music and has recently written a song that a major music star wants to record. Jean sells the song to the artist in exchange for a lump sum. In this case, Jean uses an assignment of rights contract to transfer legal ownership of the song to the artist.

**Case 2: Marie, graphic artist**

> Marie is a graphic artist who has created a fascinating album cover. A record company wants to use her design for an album by one of their artists. Marie and the record company draw up a rights assignment contract, where Marie gives up the right to use her design for this specific purpose in exchange for financial compensation.

Now that we have a few examples of how assignment of rights contracts can be used in real life, let's look at the main components of these contracts.

- Parties involved:\*\* this concerns those who assign the rights (the assignor) and those who receive them (the assignee).
- Duration of assignment:\*\* this stipulates how long the assignee holds the assigned rights.
- Financial compensation:\*\* this specifies the amount of money the assignor receives in exchange for assigning his rights.
- Rights transferred:\*\* this specifies which rights specifically are transferred.

Needless to say, negotiating these contracts requires a good understanding of their legal and financial implications. This is where the role of a copyright specialist comes in.

### Who manages these neighboring rights?

The SPPF (Société Civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France) and the SCPP (Société Civile des Producteurs Phonographiques) are two distinct entities that play a major role in the protection of musical works. They remunerate music producers for the use of their works. Let's take a look at what exactly these two terms mean, and their impact on the music industry.

### SPPF

The SPPF, or Société Civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France, is a collective management company. Its role is essential: it collects and redistributes the neighboring rights owed to independent phonogram producers when their recordings are used in France and abroad. Its mission is to defend the interests of these producers.

> The SPPF plays an essential role in protecting the rights of independent music producers.

### SCPP

The SCPP (Société Civile des Producteurs Phonographiques) is also a collective management company, but represents the interests of major and independent phonographic producers. It collects and distributes neighboring rights from these producers when their phonograms or videograms are used.

> "The SCPP defends the interests of music producers, whether major or independent."

It's important for producers to understand the importance of these organizations. They ensure that the royalties due to them are collected and redistributed fairly.

- SPPF\*\*: Société pour les producteurs de phonogrammes en France.
- SCPP\*\*: Société pour les producteurs phonographiques.
