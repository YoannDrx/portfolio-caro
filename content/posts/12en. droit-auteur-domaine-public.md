# Copyright in the public domain: what it means for artists and producers.

### What is the public domain?

Public domain\*\* is a term frequently used in the arts and music industry. But what does it really mean for artists and their work? Let me explain.

> Public domain refers to creative works that are no longer protected by copyright. Generally speaking, this means that these works can be used freely by anyone, for any purpose.

But why do some works enter the public domain? And how does this affect artists' copyright? Here are a few key points to help you understand:

- Duration of copyright:\_ As a specific rule, copyright expires 70 years after the death of the author. After this period, the work enters the public domain.
- Transfer of rights:\_ An artist may decide to place his or her work in the public domain before copyright expires. In this case, the artist relinquishes all proprietary rights.
- Copyright law:\_ Some countries have specific laws that place certain works directly in the public domain, regardless of the duration of copyright.

In turn, a work in the public domain can be freely reproduced, distributed, performed, used to create derivative works or even sold by anyone, without requiring the authorization of the copyright owner. It's important for artists to understand these points in order to protect their works and navigate the legal landscape of the music industry. In the following sections, we'll explore these topics in detail.

### How a work enters the public domain

One of the most fundamental aspects of copyright lies in the question of when and how a work enters the public domain. This is a crucial phase for any creative work, because when this happens, the work becomes accessible to all, without restrictions. So how exactly does this happen? Let's take a look. **Before we dive in:**

> In general, a work enters the public domain when the copyright for that work has expired. This is when exclusive control, protection and commercial exploitation of the work are no longer reserved to the author or rights holder.

- In France, copyright generally lasts for the lifetime of the author, plus 70 years after his death.
- Sometimes, an author may voluntarily choose to allow his or her work to fall into the public domain. This is usually done by means of a written declaration.
- Contracts for assignment of rights:\*\* An author may choose to assign his or her copyright to a third party. In doing so, he or she may stipulate that the work must fall into the public domain after a certain time or under certain conditions.

To fully understand each case, it's crucial to know the copyright and specific laws that apply to your works, which may require some research or legal consultation. In all cases, placing a work in the public domain opens the door to its reuse and sharing by all, thus contributing to the cultural richness of our society.

### Using public domain works in your music

If you're a music artist or producer, the idea of using public domain works in your work can be an interesting option. Before we delve into this fascinating subject, let's start by defining public domain.

> Public domain refers to works whose copyrights have expired, been waived, or are inapplicable. These works can be freely used by anyone, without having to obtain permission or pay royalties.

Here are a few points to consider when using public domain works in your music:

- Verification:\*\* It's crucial to check that the work you want to use is actually in the public domain. Don't simply assume that just because a work is old, it's necessarily royalty-free.
- Adaptations:\*\* It's important to note that if a public domain work has been adapted or modified in any way, that specific version of the work may not be in the public domain.
- Neighboring rights:\*\* Even if a musical composition is in the public domain, specific recordings of that composition may still be protected by neighboring rights.
- Obtaining the work:\*\* The way in which you obtain the work from the public domain can also have legal implications. It's best to use reliable sources that guarantee that the work is actually in the public domain.

It's always a good idea to consult a copyright lawyer before using public domain works in your music to avoid any potential copyright infringement.

### Risks and benefits of using the public domain

Public domain copyright refers to artistic or cultural works that are no longer, or never were, protected by copyright. The use of these works can present considerable advantages, but also potential risks. As a music professional, it's essential to understand these. **Benefits of using the public domain:**

- _Accessibility:_ Essentially, public domain works are available free of charge and can be used without paying royalties or obtaining licenses.
- Creative flexibility:\_ Artists can freely integrate, adapt and reinterpret these works in their own creations.
- Commercial potential:\_ Public domain works can be marketed and sold, opening up new revenue opportunities.

**Risks of using the public domain:**

1. Copyright infringement:\_ The work may not actually be in the public domain, encouraging possible copyright infringement.
2. Complex legal issues:\_ Copyright laws differ from country to country, which can make it difficult to determine the true status of a work.
3. Reputational damage:\_ The use of a work in the public domain that later turns out to be protected by copyright can damage an artist's or company's professional reputation.

> In conclusion, it is always advisable to seek legal advice before starting the process of using a public domain work, to avoid any legal risks and protect your interests.

### Famous examples of the use of public domain works

Music plays a crucial role in our culture, and much of it is in the public domain. Here are some famous examples of how public domain works have been reused and transformed into new artistic creations.

- Happy Birthday": This is probably the most famous song in the world. Long under copyright, it is now in the public domain. It's an excellent example of how a work in the public domain can be used in countless ways.
- Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake: This classical music has been reused in numerous commercials, films and even hip-hop artists. Its availability in the public domain has enabled countless reinterpretations.
- The works of **Mozart**: His symphonies and operas are frequently played by musicians and orchestras all over the world without having to pay royalties.
- Paintings by _Vincent Van Gogh_: His works, such as "Starry Night", are often reprinted and reproduced. They are used as decorations in homes and offices, on T-shirts and other merchandising.

> Public domain works offer an immense source of inspiration for today's artists, musicians and authors. They are a treasure trove of our culture and a pillar of creativity and innovation.

### Public domain in the digital age

The **public domain in the digital age** is a subject that is becoming increasingly relevant. Before delving into the details, let's start by defining what we mean by 'public domain' in the context of copyright.

> The public domain refers to all works or expressions of the mind - whether text, music, art or other forms of creativity - that are not protected by copyright. These works can be freely used by anyone for any purpose.

With the advent of the digital age, the notion of the public domain has taken on a whole new dimension. Questions arise as to how these works can be used and shared in today's digital context. Here are some key points to consider:

- Access to and use of public domain works:\*\* Thanks to digitization and online distribution, access to these works has never been easier. However, this can also give rise to potential copyright infringement due to a lack of understanding of the legal nuances.
- Digitization of public domain works:\*\* Who should be responsible for digitizing works? This is an important question, as poor-quality digitization can alter the original work.
- The role of libraries and institutions:\*\* These entities play a major role in preserving public domain works and making them available to the public. They must therefore be aware of their responsibilities.

In summary, understanding and navigating the public domain in the digital age can be a real challenge. However, with a good understanding of the laws and regulations, it can also offer enormous opportunities for content creation and distribution.
