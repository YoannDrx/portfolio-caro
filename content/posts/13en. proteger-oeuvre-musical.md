# How to protect a musical work: practical and legal steps.

### How to register a work

Registering a work is an essential step in protecting your copyright and ensuring that you receive all the benefits associated with your creation. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to register a work:

1. **Creating the work:** First of all, you need to create your work. This can be a song, a musical score, lyrics, or any other form of musical creation.
2. **Defining your rights:** Understanding your rights as an author is essential. These include your right to be recognized as the author of the work, and to benefit economically from your work.
3. \*\*Registering your work with a copyright organization, such as SACEM or Spedidam, enables you to protect your rights. This registration proves that you are the author of the work and that you own the rights to it.
4. \*\*If you wish to assign your rights to a third party (e.g. a record company), you need to negotiate a rights assignment contract. This defines the conditions of the assignment, such as the amount of royalties you will receive.
5. **Receiving your royalties:** Finally, once your work has been used (for example, broadcast on the radio or sold as a CD), you are entitled to royalties. These must be collected by the organization that manages your rights, and paid to you.

> Note: It is always advisable to consult a copyright expert or lawyer before making any decisions that could affect your rights.

### The advantages of official recording

In the music business, the official recording of a work is an essential step. It is the first tangible protection of your creation. Let's take a look at the advantages of official registration.

- Proof of ownership:\*\* First and foremost, registering a work proves your status as a creator. In the event of disputes or plagiarism, it gives you the power to defend your rights.
- Protection against theft:\_ Without official registration, your work is at the mercy of intellectual property thieves. Registration prevents this from happening.
- Exploitation of your work:\*\* Whether through commercial exploitation or public dissemination, official registration enables you to exploit your work legally. It facilitates the receipt of income linked to these activities.
- Facilitating the transfer of rights:\_ If you wish to transfer the rights to your work to a publisher, for example, registration greatly facilitates this process.

> "Official registration is the assurance of peace of mind for all creators. It confirms your status as an author and protects your work from plagiarism, while authorizing you to exploit your work on your own terms."

As you can see, official registration represents substantial protection for your work, while giving you the opportunity to benefit from its financial spin-offs. It's an essential step for any musical creator.

### Other forms of protection

Protection for your artistic works is not limited to Sacem, Spedidam or Sdrm. There are several other forms of protection for artistic works, and it's essential to be aware of them to ensure that your rights are fully protected. These forms of protection offer different ways of protecting your works, and can be complementary.

**Other forms of protection include:**

- Neighboring rights:\*\* These are rights granted to certain individuals (such as actors, singers and directors) in recognition of their contributions to a work.
- Copyright:\*\* This is a legal protection granted by law to authors of original works. In France, these rights are protected by the Intellectual Property Code.
- Moral rights:\*\* This is the author's inalienable and imprescriptible right to be associated with and protect his work.
- droit de suite:\*\* This is a right that may be granted to visual artists and their heirs, enabling them to receive a percentage of the sale price each time their work is resold.

> It is crucial to realize that these forms of protection often coexist. For example, an artist may have neighboring rights and copyright on the same work. These protections are often complementary, and can offer you more comprehensive protection.

### Costs associated with protecting a work of art

Protecting an artistic work is essential if you're an artist seeking recognition while preserving your rights. However, there are often costs associated with this protection that you need to take into account. Here are a few of these costs:

- Registration fees:\*\* Whether for SACEM, SPEDIDAM, or SDRM, registration always has a cost. This cost may vary according to the registration authority and the type of work.
- Legal fees:\*\* Copyright protection may require the services of a lawyer or copyright professional. These services can be expensive, especially if you need in-depth legal advice or find yourself in a conflict situation.
- Administration fees:\*\* Rights management organizations such as SACEM or SPEDIDAM often charge fees for administering your rights and monitoring the use of your work.
- Social security contributions:\*\* As an artist, you are potentially considered self-employed. As a result, you will have to pay social security contributions.

> It's important to evaluate these costs before you start. They can represent a significant part of your budget, especially if you're an emerging artist. However, remember that protecting the rights to your work is an investment that can pay off in the long term.

### Common mistakes to avoid when protecting your work in the music industry

As a creator in the music industry, you're likely to make several common mistakes that can jeopardize the protection of your works. Knowing what these mistakes are and how to avoid them is essential to your success.

1. **Failure to register with SACEM or another copyright organization:** The first step in protecting your works is to register with SACEM or another copyright organization. These organizations are designed to defend and manage your copyright, ensuring that you are compensated for the use of your work.
2. **Failure to keep your registrations up to date:** All modifications, whether changing the name of the work or adding a co-author, must be updated in your SACEM, SPEDIDAM or SDRM registrations to guarantee your right to fair compensation.
3. **Lack of knowledge of the various rights assignment contracts:** A properly drafted rights assignment contract can protect you from numerous legal disputes and guarantee your royalties. It is therefore crucial to understand how these contracts work and to negotiate them accordingly.
4. **Failure to understand the extension of your rights assignment:** Some rights assignment contracts may extend to other areas than you initially thought. Misreading this contract can lead to a loss of control over how your music is used.

Protecting your works in the music industry can seem like a complex process, but by avoiding these common mistakes, you can secure your rights and maximize your income.
