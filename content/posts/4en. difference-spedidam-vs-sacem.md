# SPEDIDAM vs SACEM: what are the differences and how do they affect artists?

SPEDIDAM and SACEM, although both collective rights management organizations, play distinct roles with regard to artists.

SACEM, for its part, is dedicated to authors, composers and music publishers. SPEDIDAM, on the other hand, focuses on performing artists.

Explanation: when a recording is broadcast to the public or performed live, additional rights (beyond the simple fee) are attributed to the performers. It is in this context that ADAMI intervenes to orchestrate their distribution.

- If you're a singer-songwriter, you can't do without registering with **la SACEM and SPEDIDAM**. Otherwise, you risk losing part of your legitimate rights.
- For a songwriter who refrains from performing in public or recording, **registration with SPEDIDAM is not an obligation**.
- Similarly, a performer who does not compose his or her own music may dispense with **membership of SACEM**.

Note that SPEDIDAM is a direct competitor of ADAMI. They have the same mission, but different memberships. In fact, simultaneous membership of both societies is strictly forbidden.

## And what's the difference between SACEM and ADAMI?

Like SACEM, ADAMI is an entity dedicated to the collective management of copyright.

But note that while SACEM concentrates on authors, composers and music publishers, ADAMI handles the rights reserved for performers.

When a recording is played in public or performed live, additional royalties are allocated to the performers, and this is where ADAMI comes in to ensure their proper distribution.

- A word of advice for singer-songwriters: **registering with SACEM and ADAMI is essential** to avoid losing part of your rights.
- If you are a songwriter who does not perform in public or take part in recordings, **registration with ADAMI is not necessary**.
- On the other hand, if you are a performer who does not compose music, it **is not necessary to register with SACEM**.

It is important to know that ADAMI is a **concurrent** organization with SPEDIDAM*:* their missions are identical, but their membership differs, since it is forbidden to be a member of both societies at the same time.
