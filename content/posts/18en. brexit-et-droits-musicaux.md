### The implications of Brexit on music copyrights.

### The Brexit context and copyright

Britain is a major pillar of the music industry internationally. However, since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, questions persist about the impact of Brexit on music copyrights. In this article, we take a look at some of these potential implications.

**The context of Brexit**

> Brexit is the process by which the United Kingdom left the European Union. After a referendum in June 2016 in which 51.9% of voters chose to leave the EU, the UK officially left the EU on January 31, 2020.

Since then, many aspects of life in the UK have been affected, including the music industry. Many musicians and producers are concerned about how the Brexit could affect their income and copyright.

- _The end of the free movement of artists and musical works between the UK and the EU could have an impact on performance and broadcasting opportunities for British musicians._
- Uncertainty over new EU copyright rules could also have an impact on musicians' incomes.\_

Now, let's look at music copyright in the context of Brexit.

1. **Musical copyrights in the EU currently**: Musical copyrights are protected throughout the EU, which means that musicians are entitled to remuneration for their works played or broadcast throughout the EU.
2. **The impact of Brexit on music copyrights**: With Brexit, it's not yet clear whether the UK will adhere to the same copyright standards as the EU. This could have implications for the amount of royalties UK musicians can receive for the use of their works within the EU.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into these implications and offer a perspective on what the future might hold for music copyrights post-Brexit.

### Changes in copyright management

Brexit, this major change in the European political and economic landscape, also has significant impacts in the field of copyright, particularly for artists and music professionals. In this unprecedented context, it's essential for everyone to understand the changes taking place so they can adapt and continue to practice their passion or profession. Here is a brief introduction to some of these changes:

> "The European Union and the United Kingdom have established new rules regarding the management of copyright following Brexit. These changes have a direct impact on how musical works are protected and how revenues from these works are distributed."

- **Changes to copyright laws:** Before the Brexit, copyright laws were largely harmonized across the EU, offering uniform protection to artists in all member states. With Brexit, the UK has developed its own copyright laws, which may lead to differences in the way works of art are protected.
- **New licensing guidelines:** Changes to UK copyright laws may also have implications for licensing the broadcasting of music or the use of artistic works. These changes may affect how works are distributed and how royalties are collected and distributed.
- **Implications for collective management organizations:** Organizations such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM, which play a crucial role in managing copyright and redistributing royalties, must also adapt to this new reality. The Brexit may affect the way these organizations interact with their British counterparts and the way royalties are collected and distributed among the various players in the sector.

All these changes require artists and music professionals to have a new understanding of the current rules, as well as adapting their current practices. In the following sections, we look in detail at each of these changes and their implications for artists and music professionals.

### Implications for British and European artists

The **Brexit** has had many implications for different sectors, and music copyright is no exception. To understand how the Brexit has affected British and European artists, let's take a closer look.

> "The Brexit does not change copyright protection per se, but it does alter conditions of use and distribution of musical works in particular with direct implications proportional to the impact of SACEM, SPEDIDAM and SDRM."

Here are the main implications of the Brexit:

1. **Copyright royalties:** Royalties paid to British artists when they perform their musical works in the EU have tended to decrease due to the additional administrative costs associated with the UK's exit from the EU.
2. **Touring artists:** Travel for British artists to tour Europe has become more complicated and expensive, due to the end of free movement. Similarly, EU artists may be deterred from performing in the UK by visa requirements.
3. **Access to the single market:** The UK's exit from the EU single market has also meant reduced access for UK artists to a market of over 500 million consumers, with potential consequences for music sales.
4. **Rights assignment contracts:** Copyright contracts may have to be renegotiated, with potential complications for artists and publishers. Uncertainty over post-Brexit rules could also make these contracts less attractive to non-UK artists.

The **Brexit** therefore has significant implications for British and European artists. Collective rights management organizations, publishers as well as the artists themselves will have to adapt to this new environment.

### Challenges and opportunities

The Brexit has caused a certain level of uncertainty on several aspects of music copyrights, resulting in various challenges and opportunities for artists, copyright holders, music publishers, and music industry players in general. Let's take a look at some of these aspects.

> "The latest act in the Brexit saga has always left a blur around the future of music copyrights within the industry."

- **The challenges:**
  1. _Impact on artists' rights:_ With Brexit, British artists risk losing their right to receive royalties for their works distributed in the EU.
  2. _Administrative complexity:_ The UK's exit from the EU could require new bureaucratic procedures for protecting music copyrights.
  3. _Potential licensing issues:_ Brexit also raises questions about the scope of licenses granted by rights collecting societies in various countries.
- Opportunities:\*\*
  1. _Copyright renegotiation:_ The Brexit offers British artists the opportunity to renegotiate their copyrights with the rest of the EU.
  2. _Adapting UK laws:_ The UK now has the opportunity to adapt music copyright laws to its own market and interests.

To navigate this changing and uncertain environment, a thorough knowledge of the implications of Brexit on music copyrights is essential. Stay tuned for more information on this crucial topic.

### Industry responses

The Brexit has had and continues to have a significant impact on many aspects of the global economy, including music copyrights. Artists, producers, composers, and many other industry players fuel the UK music industry - an industry that contributes over Â£5 billion to the UK economy every year. However, the repercussions of Brexit are also being felt beyond the UK's borders. The complex implications of this political move on music copyrights are many and varied.

- **Rights assignments:** In the European Union, rights assignment agreements are governed by Union law. With Brexit, the UK is no longer part of the European Union, which means these laws no longer apply in the same way. Artists and copyright holders now face additional hurdles in transferring their rights beyond the UK's borders.
- **SACEM, SPEDIDAM, SDRM royalties:** Membership of these organizations is an essential part of protecting artists and their copyrights. However, the Brexit has raised questions about how royalties will be collected and redistributed. Collective management organizations in the UK can no longer operate on a "country of origin" basis, which could lead to significant changes in the way artists collect their royalties.

> "The Brexit has created considerable uncertainty for the music industry. The next few months will determine how artists will be affected and what steps they will need to take to protect their copyrights and income."

It's essential for everyone in the music industry to stay informed and take the necessary steps to adapt to this new landscape. As the world adjusts to the changes brought about by Brexit, it's essential not to underestimate the implications this move will have on all facets of music copyrights.

### What to watch out for in the future

The Brexit, a reality since 2020, has turned international treaties and agreements upside down. As a professional in the field, no doubt you're keeping a close eye on developments. Music and associated copyright are not left out, and several points deserve particular attention:

- **Multi-territorial licenses:** after Brexit, all licenses that previously covered the UK as a member of the European Union may no longer be valid. Music authors must therefore be vigilant if they authorize the use of their works in the UK.
- SACEM rules:\*\* Until now, SACEM royalties for the use of music within the EU were distributed without any problems. Now, due to the Brexit, uncertainties hang over the distribution of rights.
- SPEDIDAM and SDRM:\*\* As with SACEM, it is highly likely that Brexit will have an impact on the operation of these two societies.
- Copyright:\*\* The European directive on copyright in the digital single market will no longer apply in the UK. This means that British artists will be excluded from some of the benefits they enjoyed as a member of the EU.
