Grant management

<!-- section:end -->

The main aim of grant organizations is to boost the music economy by circulating funds. More fundamentally, the essence of these financial aids is to stimulate artistic creation while reinforcing the sustainability of employment for artists. The assistance requested must therefore serve to reinforce the budget and thus enrich the implementation of the project.

> The aim of a grant application is to present a faithful and honest reflection of the project: all elements must be mentioned, including any other assistance requested. Don't forget that organizations communicate with each other and cross-check information.

**Respect collective agreements:**

For a music project, the funding body will want to know how many artists and technicians are involved, and how and to what extent they are remunerated.
The employment of professional artists implies the payment of salaries, social security contributions and minimum remuneration set by legislation.
This is where collective agreements come into play.

> A collective agreement is an official document setting out the working conditions and wages specific to each professional sector. There are hundreds of such agreements.

> It is therefore crucial to consult the collective bargaining agreement for your field of activity to find out the minimum wage and specific working conditions applicable.

For example, if you are a record company employing musicians and technicians to record an album in the studio, you will need to refer to the collective agreement for **phonographic publishing**.

If you are planning to organize a concert in a rental venue, we recommend that you consult the collective agreement **for companies in the private live performance sector** to check the minimum wages to be declared.

**Drawing up a budget estimate and estimating the amount of assistance:**

The purpose of a provisional budget is to set out in figures the expansion strategy for a project. It is not necessary for professionals to go through biographies or artistic descriptions to judge the feasibility of a project. A budget analysis is often all that's needed, as it provides a clearer picture of future expenditure.

> In a budget forecast, professionals seek to assess the consistency between projected project development costs and anticipated revenues.

The amount of financial assistance is determined **BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSES**.

Please note that a collective management organization will NEVER subsidize a budget in its entirety. The financial assistance granted will only cover a portion of the expenses, hence the need to provide a perfectly adjusted budget in order to apply for the maximum amount.

**Gather administrative and promotional documents and supporting evidence:** All invoices and estimates, dated and signed, must be submitted.

- All dated and signed invoices and quotations
- proof that contributions to certain organizations have been paid (URSAFF or AUDIENS certificate)
- Distribution or licensing contracts, as well as recording contracts
- Pay slips for intermittent workers
- Artist biographies/project descriptions
- All promotional documents: press kit, media plan (i.e. press promotion strategy and objectives), future concert and/or tour dates, etc.
- Don't hesitate to write a production memo explaining point by point the nature of all your expenses.

**Managing your grant application strategically:**

The more economically and commercially your project is developed, the greater your chances of obtaining financial support.

Prepare a retro-planning for each request for assistance:

- Create an online client/member space
- Anticipate the submission of works/registrations
- Prepare the application
- Collect documents and supporting evidence
- Draw up the provisional budget
- Submit application
- Keep to the commission schedule
- Anticipate the project's release date based on the organization's response date
- Anticipate payment of grant (or advance)
- Prepare additional documents to be sent (invoices, supporting documents, etc.).

**Support for publishers and singer-songwriters:**

ADAMI is the organization that collects and then distributes **the money owed to performers** (musicians, dancers, actors...) following the broadcast of their performances on television, radio, in public places, etc. ADAMI's mission is also to redistribute part of the money collected from broadcasters (radio, TV, public venues, etc.) to **finance performers' projects**.

Insofar as these aids are aimed at working professionals, they are **less accessible to beginners**.

### SPPF: Help with recording an album

To benefit from this aid, you must already have a legal structure (even an association) and be a member of the SPPF. If you are not a member, you can still benefit from assistance if you have signed **_[a licensing contract](https://a-contretemps.com/contrats-musique-contrat-licence-exclusive/)_** with a label that is a member of the SPPF.

**_[Creative support](https://www.sppf.com/subventions/creation-production/)_**

### SCPP : Support for the creation of phonograms

**_[Rules of attribution](https://www.scpp.fr/SCPP/Home/AIDES/R%E8glesdattributiondesaides/tabid/144/Default.aspx#ancre2)_**.

Access to aid is exclusively reserved for member producers. This procedure is logical, since the financial assistance fund is fed by revenues generated by the distribution of the works of these same producers. It's a system of internal redistribution.

- CNM :

**_[Aides Ã  la production phonographique du CNM](https://cnm.fr/aides/musique-enregistree/production-phonographique/)_**

The CNM represents the largest and most powerful gathering of all the major players in the music industry. Unlike its predecessor (CNV), which also covered the arts of theater, dance and opera, the CNM is now dedicated to supporting music professionals (artists (author, composer) and other industry professionals (phonographic publisher, manager, producer)). All **are concerned by the CNM's missions** and are invited to take part in the various consultations.

All collecting societies contribute to the CNM's budget, as does the French Ministry of Culture. The [CNM missions](https://cnm.fr/qui-sommes-nous/les-missions-du-cnm/)
