# Performance royalties: how they are calculated and distributed.

### What is a performance royalty?

The question "What is a performance royalty?" is an excellent starting point for understanding the financial organization of the music industry. Cobbant all the while, it's important to clear up any misunderstandings. A performance royalty is a sum of money that artists receive each time their works are broadcast or performed in public.

**In other words**, this means that every time a song is played on the radio, in a bar, restaurant or even at a concert, the artist and others involved must be paid. These payments generally go to the artist, but also to composers, producers and other rights holders.

> It's a legally regulated process in which the performance of a musical work generates remuneration for the parties involved.

-   Performance royalties cover a multitude of circumstances, from concerts to music streaming services, radio and television.
-   In general, these royalties are collected by collective management organizations such as SACEM in France.

Generally speaking, performance royalties can be divided into two categories:

1. **Royalties from concerts and live performances** These are sums paid to artists each time they perform in front of an audience. The amount of these royalties generally varies according to the size of the event.
2. \*\*Royalties from the public performance of music are paid to artists every time their music is played in a public space, whether in a shopping mall, a restaurant, a sports hall or even during a phone call on hold.

Performance royalties are an important source of income for music creators. Understanding how they work can help you better navigate the complex landscape of the music industry.

### How are they collected and distributed?

**Collecting and distributing performance royalties in the music industry** is a complex process involving several parties. This is largely made possible by the intervention of specialized organizations, such as SACEM, SPEDIDAM, SDRM among others. But how exactly are these royalties collected and distributed? Let's find out together.

-   Collection:\*\* The first step in the process begins with the collection of royalties. This is usually done through collecting societies (such as SACEM), which license the use of musical compositions on various platforms and collect the royalties due on their account.
-   Royalty calculation:\*\* Once royalties have been collected, they are calculated according to the royalty rate and the number of times the work has been used or performed.
-   Distribution:\*\* After calculation, these royalties are then distributed to authors, composers and publishers in proportion to the use of their works.

> It should be noted that there are also royalties for performers and phonogram producers. These are administered by SPEDIDAM for live performances and remuneration for private copying, and SDRM for mechanical reproduction.

Understanding this process is the key to successfully navigating the music industry, which is truly shaped by copyright and the protection of the artist's work.

### Organizations involved in performance royalties

In the music industry, various organizations play a key role in the payment and distribution of performance royalties to artists. These organizations manage artists' rights, and calculate and collect performance royalties. Here's a quick overview of the main organizations involved in this process:

1. **SACEM (Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique):** This is the main French organization that collects royalties and distributes them to artists. It also protects artists' rights to their works.
2. **SPEDIDAM (Société de Perception et de Distribution des Droits des Artistes-Interprètes) :** SPEDIDAM manages performers' rights for the exploitation of their sound recordings.
3. **SDRM (Société pour l'administration du droit de reproduction mécanique des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs):** This organization administers mechanical reproduction rights for musical works on all media.

These organizations are responsible for collecting royalties from music users and paying them out to artists. It is through their painstaking work that artists are remunerated for their hard work and talent.

> Performance royalties are an essential part of an artist's income. They represent the financial compensation he receives for the use of his works."

So understanding how these organizations work and the role they play in paying performance royalties can be a great way for artists to better navigate the music industry.
